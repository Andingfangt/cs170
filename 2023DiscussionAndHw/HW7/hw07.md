## 2. Non-Prefix Code

Your task is to, given a bit string s，determine whether it is possible to interpret s as a sequence of symbols. The mapping from symbols to bit strings of the code will be given to you as a dictionary d (e.g., in the example, d = {A ∶ 1,B∶ 01,C : 101} ); you may assume that you can access each symbol in the dictionary in constant time.

(a) $f(i)$ represent whether it is possible for $s[:i]$ using d

```python
def f(i):
    '''
    return A[i], which is a boolean variable representing 
    whether s[: i] can be represented by a sequence of encodings. 
    '''
    n = len(s)
    A = [False] * (n+1)
    A[0] = True

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for symbol a in d:
            # whether it is possible to interpret s[: i] with a as its last symbol
            if i >= len(d[a]) and d[a] == s[i - len(d[a]) + 1 : i]:
                A[i] = A[i] or A[i - len(d[a])]
    
    return A[n]
```

**Runtime:**  $n$ iterations of the outer for loop and $k = len(d)$ iterations of the inner for loop, and takes $l = max(len(d[a])) $ time to check whether two strings are equal.
$\therefore $ total runtime is $\Omicron(nkl)$

## 3. Ideal Targets

You are given a directed acyclic graph $G = (V,E)$ with unweighted edges. Every vertex $v \in V$  has an integer score $s[v]$. For a vertex u, we say that a vertex $u$ is an ideal target for $v$ if out of all vertices that u can reach，$u$ is the one with the maximum score.

* PS:   $v$ can be its own ideal target.

Ask to find the  ideal targets for all vertex
$f(v)$ return $v$'s ideal target
$$f(v) = max (\underset{(v,u) \in E}{max} f(u), s[v])$$

If want bottom up, just reverse the graph $G$ in topological sort.

**Runtime:** $\Omicron(|V|+|E|)$

## 4. Egg Drop

Given $m$ identical eggs and an $n$ story building. Figure out the highest floor $l \in {0,1,2,...n}$ that you can drop an egg from without breaking it. Egg will not break when dropped from floor $\leq l$，and breaks $>l$. ($l= 0$ means the egg always breaks). Once an egg breaks,you cannot use it any more. However, if an egg does not break, you can reuse it.

Let $f (n, m)$ be the minimum number of egg drops that are needed to find $l$.

(a)
$f(1,m) = 1$ do one drop at floor = 1, if break $l=0$ else $l=1$.
$f(0,m) = 0, l$ must be 0.
$f(n,1) = n$ since we only have one egg, drop it from 1 to n until it break.
$f(n,0) = \infty$ no egg.

(b)
Dropping an egg at floor a when there are $n$ floors and $m$ eggs left.
if break: $f(n,m) = f(x-1,m-1)+1$
else: $f(n,m) = f(n-x,m)+1$

(c): 
$$f(n,m)=\underset{x\in [1,n]}{min}\{ max(f(x-1, m-1), f(n-x,m)) \}$$

(d):

```python
def f(n,m):
    mem = [[None for i in range(m)] for j in range(n)]
    # base case
    mem[1] = [1] * m # f(1,m) = 1
    mem[0] = [0] * m # f(0,m) = 0
    for i in range(,n+1):
        mem[i][1] = i # f(n,1) = n
        mem[i][0] = float('inf') # f(n,0) = inf

    for i in range(2, n+1):
        for j in range(2, m+1):
            for x in range(1, n+1):
                mem[i][j] = min(
                    max(
                        mem[x-1][j-1], mem[i-x][j]
                    )
                )
    
    return mem[n][m]
```

(e):

## 5. My Dog Ate My Homework

**Input:** Dimensions of the paper $m * n$ and an array $A[i,j]$ such that $A[i,j]= 1$ if and only if the $ij^{th}$ square has holes bitten into it.
**Goal:** Find the minimum number of cuts needed so that the $A[i,j]$ values of each piece are either all 0 or all 1.
(Each cut is either horizontal or vertical, and of one piece of paper at a time.)

(a) 
if cut horizontal, there are m-1 ways, from $([:1], [1:]) \to ([:m-1], [m-1:])$
if cut vertical, there are n-1 ways, from $([:1], [1:]) \to ([:n-1], [n-1:])$

let $f(a,b,c,d)$ to be the minimum cut for $A[a:b][c:d]$
$\therefore$ 

* $f(a,b,c,d) = 0$ if all values equal.
* else, if cut at $x$ horizontal $f(a,b,c,d) = 1 + f(a, x , c, d) + f(x, b, c, d)$, $x\in [a+1,b-1]$
* else, if cut at $y$ vertical $f(a,b,c,d) = 1 + f(a, b, c, y) + f(a, b, y, d)$, $y\in [c+1,d-1]$

(b) 

```python
def all_equal(subarray):
    return all([value] for value in subarray)

def f(0,m,0,n):
    mem = dict()

    for a in range(m):
        for b in range(a+1,m+1):
            for c in range(n):
                for d in range(c+1, n+1):
                    if all_equal(A[a:b][c:d]):
                        mem[f'({a},{b},{c},{d})'] = 0
                    else:
                        min_x = min([1 + mem[f'({a},{x},{c},{d})'] + mem[f'({x},{b},{c},{d})'] for x in range(a+1,b)])
                        min_y = min([1 + mem[f'({a},{b},{c},{y})'] + mem[f'({a},{b},{y},{d})'] for y in range(c+1,d)])

                        mem[f'({a},{b},{c},{d})'] = min(min_x, min_y)

return mem[f'({0},{m},{0},{n})'] 
```
