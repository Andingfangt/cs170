## Q2

Giving two sorted array A and B, len(A) = len(B) = k, give a Algorithm to find the $k^{th}$ elements.

$def\quad f(A, b, k):$
**n is odd situation:**


1. $a = A[(k+1)/2], b=B[(k+1)/2]$
2. if a < b, so b is at least $\frac{k+1}{2} + \frac{k-1}{2} = k^{th}$, so the answer must be in $A[\frac{k-1}{2}:] and B[:(\frac{k-1}{2} +1)]$
3. so the cut down number is $\frac{k-1}{2}\therefore \text{return } f(A[\frac{k-1}{2}:], B[:(\frac{k-1}{2} +1)],k-\frac{k-1}{2})$
4. else, do the same thing by just  exchanging A and B. 
5. base case: A = [a], B = [b], k = 1, return min(a,b).

**n is even situation:**
no big different.


**Runtime:**
$T(k,k) = T(\dfrac{k}{2},\dfrac{k}{2}) + \Omicron(1) \Rightarrow T(n) = \Omicron(\log k)$

## 3. Counting multiples of 3

Giving an array A of n distinct non-negative integers, count the number odd-sized subsets of A whose elements add up to a multiple of 3.

1. split array into 2 parts, do counting algorithm recursively left and right side. it should all return a table contains:

|  | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| -| - | - | - |
| odd | | | |
|even | | | |

2. base case: [i], array length is 1,if example i mod 3 = 1, it has subset [i] and [], [] always donate to (even, 1, 0, 0), and in this case [i] donates to (odd, 0, 1, 0).
   
|  | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| -| - | - | - |
| odd |0|1|0|
|even |1|0|0|

3. then we merge tow parts, using both side's return table, whose runtime is $\Omicron(n\log n)$

4. [codes](./count_multiples_of_3.py)

**Runtime:**
$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Omicron(n\log n) \Rightarrow T(n) = \Omicron(n(\log n)^2)$


## 4. The Resistance
n players has s spies.

1. split the team into two parts. and both send to mission.
2. if one group succeed in mission, return [ ], and recursively check for the other rest players.
3. base case: if only one player and mission failed, then it is the spy, return an array contain it.
4. merge two parts and return the whole array contains all the spires.

**Mission times:**
![å›¾ 1](../../images/hw02_Q4.png)  
if we have s spies, then:
$$\text{Mission\_count} = \sum_{i=0}^{\log_2n}(\text{mission number in level i}) \\ \leq \sum_{i=0}^{\log_2 n}min(2^i,s) \\ \leq \sum_{i=0}^{\log_2 s}2^i + \sum_{\log_2s + 1}^{\log_2n}s \\ \leq \dfrac{1(0-2^{\log_2s + 1})}{1-2} + s*(\log_2n-\log_2s) \\ \leq 2s + s*(\log_2n-\log_2s) \\ \leq s(2+\log_2{\dfrac{n}{s}}) \\ = \Omicron(s\log(\frac{n}{s}))$$


## Werewolves

* You don't know anyone's identity, bnt all your friends do.
* There always more citizens than werewolves.
* goal: to identify one who is certain to be citizen.
* one query: taking two people x and y, ask x to identify y and y to identify x.
  
(a) give a way using $\Omicron(n)$ queries to identify a single player is a citizen: let all the other n-1 people identify this man's identity, if citizen_numbers >= werewolves_numbers, than this man is citizen, otherwise is werewolves.

(b) find a citizen in $\Omicron(n\log n)$ queries: 

1. split the group A into 2 parts R and L.
2. f(R) return the citizen by algorithm in R, so do f(L), one part must has more citizen than werewolves, and the other may not.
3. base case: if a group only has one person, return it and identify it as citizen.
4. use whole group A to identify those two's identity in (a), and return the certain citizen. Which cost $\Omicron(2n)$ in every level.

**Runtime:**
$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Omicron(2n) \Rightarrow T(n) = \Omicron(n\log n)$

(c) find a citizen in liner-time:

there are three situation in pair: (c,c), (c,w), (w,w)

1. for each pair, do query, if one said the other is w, kill them all; otherwise kill one person randomly.
2. recursively do for the left people, until one player.
3. this man must be citizen.

**Runtime:**
$T(n) = T(n/2) + \Omicron(n/2) \Rightarrow T(n) = \Omicron(n)$
