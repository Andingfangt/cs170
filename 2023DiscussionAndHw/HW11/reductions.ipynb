    "Namely, there exist many solver packages for Integer Linear Programming (CPLEX, Gurobi) and SAT (Glucose, Maplesat, Z3) which have been highly optimized over the course of several decades. Although these solvers take exponential time since ILP and SAT are NP-complete, good solver packages use advanced algorithms and are highly optimized, meaning they are very fast on reasonably-sized inputs. Rather than implement a solver from scratch, it may be more efficient to reduce a problem to integer LP or SAT in polynomial time and then call an existing solver library. \n",
